\section{Abstract}\label{sec:Abstract}

In this work the problem of calibrating microscopic car-following parameters using aggregated traffic data, of the form collected by RDS sensors, is explored. In particular, the calibraiton of parameters that are not observable via historical macroscopic data (i.e. the Fundamental Diagram) is considered, and it is found that based on a naive objective function comparing time-series values and a common simulation-based optimization routine, known parameters cannot be recovered accurately. An improved objective function that utilizes statistics from both the time-domain and the frequency-domain is proposed that is better able to better recover the parameters. It is also found that parameter values with significant instabilities of the form that produce phantom traffic jams are more easily recovered than those with small or no instabilities. Finally a robustness analysis is run that varies hyper-parameters of the model
