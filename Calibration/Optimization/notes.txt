#Calibration of a stochastic python simulation

"Awesome so Nelder-Mead (scipy.optimize.fmin()) or Powell (scipy.optimize.fmin_powell()), can deal with noisy results. â€“ Davoud Taghawi-Nejad Oct 19 '15 at 15:09"

"Scipy cannot deal with noisy data well."

#callback functions:

def callback_on_optimization_indicator(x, f, accepted, threshold=2):
    if f > threshold:
        print(x, f, accepted, threshold)
        return True
    else:
        return False

#basin hopping:
callback : callable, callback(x, f, accept), optional
A callback function which will be called for all minimum found. x and f are the coordinates and function value of the trial minima, and accept is whether or not that minima was accepted. This can be used, for example, to save the lowest N minima found. Also, callback can be used to specify a user defined stop criterion by optionally returning True to stop the basinhopping routine.
