high level algo:
1) look at a certain stretch on the road (e.g. 300 m to 700 m)
2) for X seconds extract the velocity information of each car that traversed that stretch of road
3) get average velocity for each car and then calculate the average velocity of all cars
4) store the aggregate average velocity and use this information to plot the graphs
