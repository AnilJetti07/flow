  abstract={A traffic jam on a highway is a very familiar phenomenon. From the physical viewpoint, the system of vehicular flow is a non-equilibrium system of interacting particles (vehicles). The collective effect of the many-particle system induces the instability of a free flow state caused by the enhancement of fluctuations, and the transition to a jamming state occurs spontaneously if the average vehicle density exceeds a certain critical value. Thus, a bottleneck is only a trigger and not the essential origin of a traffic jam. In this paper, we present the first experimental evidence that the emergence of a traffic jam is a collective phenomenon like 'dynamical' phase transitions and pattern formation in a non-equilibrium system. We have performed an experiment on a circuit to show the emergence of a jam with no bottleneck. In the initial condition, all the vehicles are moving, homogeneously distributed on the circular road, with the same velocity. The average density of the vehicles is prepared for the onset of the instability. Even a tiny fluctuation grows larger and then the homogeneous movement cannot be maintained. Finally, a jam cluster appears and propagates backward like a solitary wave with the same speed as that of a jam cluster on a highway.}

,abstract = { The calibration of traffic microsimulation models has received widespread attention in transportation modeling. A recent concern is whether these models can simulate traffic conditions realistically. The recent widespread deployment of intelligent transportation systems in North America has provided an opportunity to obtain traffic-related data. In some cases the distribution of the traffic data rather than simple measures of central tendency such as the mean, is available. This paper examines a method for calibrating traffic microsimulation models so that simulation results, such as travel time, represent observed distributions obtained from the field. The approach is based on developing a statistically based objective function for use in an automated calibration procedure. The Wilcoxon rank–sum test, the Moses test and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test are used to test the hypothesis that the travel time distribution of the simulated and the observed travel times are statistically identical. The approach is tested on a signalized arterial roadway in Houston, Texas. It is shown that potentially many different parameter sets result in statistically valid simulation results. More important, it is shown that using simple metrics, such as the mean absolute error, may lead to erroneous calibration results. }

    abstract = { GENOSIM is a generic traffic microsimulation parameter optimization tool that uses genetic algorithms and was implemented in the Port Area network in downtown Toronto, Canada. GENOSIM was developed as a pilot software as part of the pursuit of a fast, systematic, and robust calibration process. It employs the state of the art in combinatorial parametric optimization to automate the tedious task of hand calibrating traffic microsimulation models. The employed global search technique, genetic algorithms, can be integrated with any dynamic traffic microscopic simulation tool. In this research, Paramics, the microscopic traffic simulation platform currently adopted at the University of Toronto Intelligent Transportation Systems Centre, was used. Paramics consists of high-performance, cross-linked traffic models that have multiple user adjustable parameters. Genetic algorithms in GENOSIM manipulate the values of those control parameters and search for an optimal set of values that minimize the discrepancy between simulation output and real field data. Results obtained by replicating observed vehicle counts are promising. }

    abstract = { In recent years, microsimulation has become increasingly important in transportation system modeling. A potential issue is whether these models adequately represent reality and whether enough data exist with which to calibrate these models. There has been rapid deployment of intelligent transportation system (ITS) technologies in most urban areas of North America in the last 10 years. While ITSs are developed primarily for real-time traffic operations, the data are typically archived and available for traffic microsimulation calibration. A methodology, based on the sequential simplex algorithm, that uses ITS data to calibrate microsimulation models is presented. The test bed is a 23-km section of Interstate 10 in Houston, Texas. Two microsimulation models, CORSIM and TRANSIMS, were calibrated for two different demand matrices and three periods (morning peak, evening peak, and off-peak). It was found for the morning peak that the simplex algorithm had better results then either the default values or a simple, manual calibration. As the level of congestion decreased, the effectiveness of the simplex approach also decreased, as compared with standard techniques. }

    abstract = { The past few years have seen a rapid evolution in the sophistication of traffic microsimulation models and a consequent major expansion of their use in transportation engineering and planning practice. Researchers and practitioners have employed an extensive array of approaches to calibrate these models and have selected a wide range of parameters to calibrate and a broad range of acceptance criteria. A methodical, top-down approach to model calibration is outlined; it focuses the initial effort on a few key parameters that have the greatest impact on model performance and then proceeds to less critical parameters to finalize the calibration. A three-step calibration/validation process is recommended. First, the model is calibrated for capacity at the key bottlenecks in the system (the capacity calibration step). Second, the model is calibrated for traffic flows at nonbottleneck locations in the system (the route choice calibration step). Finally, the overall model performance is calibrated against field-measured system performance measures such as travel time and delay (the system performance calibration step). This three-step process is illustrated in an example application for a freeway/arterial corridor. }

    abstract = { A procedure for constructing and calibrating a detailed model of a freeway by using VISSIM is presented and applied to a 15-mi stretch of I-210 West in Pasadena, California. This test site provides several challenges for microscopic modeling: a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane with an intermittent barrier, a heavy freeway connector, 20 metered on-ramps with and without HOV bypass lanes, and three interacting bottlenecks. Field data used as input to the model were compiled from two separate sources: loop detectors on the on-ramps and main line (PeMS) and a manual survey of on-ramps and off-ramps. Gaps in both sources made it necessary to use a composite data set, constructed from several typical days. FREQ was used as an intermediate tool to generate a set of origin-destination matrices from the assembled boundary flows. The model construction procedure consists of (1) identification of important geometric features, (2) collection and processing of traffic data, (3) analysis of the main-line data to identify recurring bottlenecks, (4) VISSIM coding, and (5) calibration based on observations from Step 3. A qualitative set of goals was established for the calibration. These were met with relatively few modifications to VISSIM's driver behavior parameters. }

    abstract = { Several methodological issues in setting up a calibration process for traffic microsimulation models are still unresolved. The influence of individual parameters of microscopic models on simulated traffic dynamics is also far from clear. To address those issues, the paper sets up a methodology based on the sensitivity analysis of traffic flow models (the one used here is AIMSUN). Sensitivity analysis was performed by means of a series of 30 analyses of variance. These were designed to evaluate the effect of parameters on the variance of the simulated outputs and to draw a general inference about (a) the proper interval for the aggregation of measurements, (b) the proper measure of performance (e.g., traffic counts versus speeds), (c) the proper traffic measurement locations, and (d) the subset of parameters to calibrate. The analysis allowed quantification of the effect of the single parameters on different traffic phases. For example, it was possible to quantify the extent of the influence of the parameter reaction time on simulated outputs in locations in which free flow, rather than congested conditions, occurs. The great differences between parameters in affecting the different traffic phases suggested that parameters are likely to be calibrated independently, that is, using data from different locations. The first evidence of the possibility of breaking the calibration problem into two subproblems is given. This entails great benefits in regard to computational time, given the exponential computational complexity of the calibration problem. }

    abstract = { Behavioral parameters in car following and other models of driving behavior are expected to be correlated. An investigation is conducted into the effect of ignoring correlations in three parameters of car-following models on the resulting movement and properties of a simulated heterogeneous vehicle traffic stream. For each model specification, parameters are calibrated for the entire sample of individual drivers with Next Generation Simulation trajectory data. Factor analysis is performed to understand the pattern of relationships between parameters on the basis of calibrated data. Correlation coefficients have been used to show statistically significant correlation between the parameters. Simulation experiments are performed with vehicle parameter sets generated with and without considering such correlation. First, parameter values are sampled from the empirical mass functions, and simulated results show significant difference in output measures when parameter correlation is captured (versus ignored). Next, parameters are sampled under the assumption that they follow the multivariate normal distribution. Results suggest that the use of parametric distribution with known correlation structure may not sufficiently reduce the error due to ignoring correlation if the underlying assumption does not hold for both marginal and joint distributions. }

abstract = "This paper describes the authors’ continued efforts toward the development, calibration, validation and application of a large-scale, agent-based model of the Buffalo-Niagara metropolitan area. The model is developed using the TRansportation ANalysis SIMulation System (TRANSIMS), an open-source, agent-based suite of transportation models originally developed by Los Alamos National Lab (LANL). Following the network error-checking, calibration and validation phases of the model development cycle, the model was used to evaluate the impact of significant snow storm events on the performance of surface transportation network. This was done by modifying the behavior of the agents (i.e. the drivers) in the model to reflect more conservative driving behavior and vehicle dynamics limitations (such as maximum acceleration and deceleration) imposed by the impaired road surface condition. The study demonstrates that the development of regional agent-based models is technically feasible, but one that requires significant efforts in terms of network accuracy checking, model calibration and validation. Moreover, it is shown that inclement weather events reduce the ability of transportation networks to handle the travel demand, which in turn underscores the importance of effective travel demand management during such events."

VISSIM microsimulation model is used for calibration done at the example of roundabouts in an urban area. The calibration method is based on the prediction of a neural network for one traffic indicator, i.e. for the traveling time between measuring points. Besides the traveling time, the calibration process further/also involves a comparison between the modeled and measured queue parameters at the entrance to the intersection. The process of validation includes an analysis of traveling time and queue parameters on new sets of data gathered both at the modeled and at a new roundabout. A comparison of the traffic indicators measured in the field and those simulated with the calibrated and uncalibrated microsimulation traffic model provides an insight into the performance of the calibration procedure."
