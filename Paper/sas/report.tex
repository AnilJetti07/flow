\title{Calibration and Sensitivity Analysis Report}
\author{Sadman Ahmed Shanto}
\date{July 2020}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

{\textbf{REQUIREMENT:} Could you actually try and put together some sort of summary with where we're at wrt the calibration and a good error function?}

\section*{Plan}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Go over to do list in VU
    \item Go over all README.md's
    \item Select materials from the above two
    \item Look at latest version of manuscript
    \item Explain the story behind Calibration
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Explain the results of different calibration
            \item Explain the various objective functions used and their results 
        \end{itemize}
    \item Think about which plots to include (figure files in local, figure files in lica, slack files to GG)
\end{itemize}



\section*{Introduction}
Flow of report:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Programs that I have written
  \item Lessons from shell script sensitivity analysis (congestion only)
  \item Calibration attemps 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item solvers
            \item attempts
            \item success
            \item takeaway from each attempt
        \end{itemize}
  \item Optimization codes and results from congested flow regime 
  \item Partial differential analysis
  \item IDM parameters recovery
  \item Good Calibration routine 
  \item Objective Function
\end{itemize}
