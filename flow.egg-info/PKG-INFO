        # About:
        
        The original [Flow](https://flow-project.github.io/) project is a computational framework for deep RL and control experiments for traffic microsimulation.
        
        This project extends the original flow framework with detailed traffic models of real-world scenarios. 
        
        # Installing Flow
        
        See [Installation instructions](http://flow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flow_setup.html) for how to install and set up flow. The process is the same for this repository, but you will need to clone from here.
